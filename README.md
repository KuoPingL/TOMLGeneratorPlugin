Feel free to file an issue if you have any question or suggestion.

Also, this code is definitely far from perfect, so any help from you is appreciated.

For anyone who wish to learn the process of creating this plugin, you are more than welcome to checkout my [medium](https://medium.com/kuos-funhouse/creating-a-plugin-for-android-studio-a-complete-walkthrough-47a154aacb7a).

## Purpose 
The purpose of this plugin is to save us from the trouble of all the copy and paste needed to create a `libs.versions.toml` file for Android Project.

## Process
The plugin takes 7 steps to make things happen :
1. **SEARCH** : Find all Gradle files (ones that contain `.gradle`)
2. **EXTRACT** : Extract dependencies and plugins asynchronously.
3. **EXTRACT TOML** : Fetch all the versions, plugins and dependencies in `libs.versions.toml` if there is one.
4. **STORE** : Create a temporary **TOML** file (`libs.versions.temp.toml`) and store extracted data based on `[versions]`, `[libraries]` and `[plugins]`. If the data inside cannot be extracted, then it will be seen as string and will placed at the end of `libs.versions.temp.toml`.
5. **WRITE** : Store all from `libs.versions.temp.toml` into `libs.versions.toml`. 
6. **CLEAN UP** : The temporary file will also be deleted.
7. **UPDATE** : Finally, the plugin will update all the Gradle files with the proper dependencies and plugins based on `libs.versions.toml`.

## FAQ
1. <u>What are the format that is covered in current version (v1.0-SNAPSHOT)?</u>

| components   | format                                                                                                          |
|:-------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Dependencies | `configuration("group:name:version")`<br> `configuration(group = "group", name = "name", version = "version")`  |
| Plugins      | `id("group:name") version "version"` (the `apply` statement will be ignored, but will keep in place at the end) |

These format will be converted into 
|toml components|format|
|:--|:--|
|`[versions]`|for dependency : `groupNameDep = "version"`<br>for plugin : `groupNamePlugin = "version"`<br>for different versions : `groupName{Dep|Plugin}-version = "version"`|
|`[libraries]`|`group-name = {group = "group", name = "name", version.ref = "groupNameDep"}` |
|`[plugins]`|`group-name = {id = "group.name", version.ref = "groupNamePlugin"}`|
